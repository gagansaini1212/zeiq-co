      <h3>Ease of access</h3>
      <p className="extra-margin-bottom">
        A key objective is engaging digital marketing customers and allowing
        them to interact with the brand through servicing and delivery of
        digital media. Information is easy to access at a fast rate through the
        use of digital communications. Users with access to the Internet can use
        many digital mediums, such as Facebook, YouTube, Forums, and Email etc.
      </p>
      <h3>Competitive advantage</h3>
      <p className="extra-margin-bottom">
        By using Internet platforms, businesses can create competitive advantage
        through various means. To reach the maximum potential of digital
        marketing, firms use social media as its main tool to create a channel
        of information. Through this a business can create a system in which
        they are able to pinpoint behavioral patterns of clients and feedback on
        their needs.
      </p>
      <h3>Effectiveness</h3>
      <p>
        Brand awareness has been proven to work with more effectiveness in
        countries that are high in uncertainty avoidance, also these countries
        that have uncertainty avoidance; social media marketing works
        effectively. Yet brands must be careful not to be excessive on the use
        of this type of marketing, as well as solely relying on it as it may
        have implications that could negatively harness their image.

      <h2>Big Data</h2>
      <p className="extra-margin-bottom">
        While the term “big data” is relatively new, the act of gathering and
        storing large amounts of information for eventual analysis is ages old.
        The concept gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst
        Doug Laney articulated the now-mainstream definition of big data as the
        three Vs.

      <p className="extra-margin-bottom">
        Organizations collect data from a variety of sources, including business
        transactions, social media and information from sensor or
        machine-to-machine data. In the past, storing it would’ve been a problem
        – but new technologies (such as Hadoop) have eased the burden.

      <h5>Velocity</h5>
      <p className="extra-margin-bottom">
        Data streams in at an unprecedented speed and must be dealt with in a
        timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart metering are driving the
        need to deal with torrents of data in near-real time.
      </p>
      <h5>Variety</h5>
      <p className="extra-margin-bottom">
        Data comes in all types of formats – from structured, numeric data in
        traditional databases to unstructured text documents, email, video,
        audio, stock ticker data and financial transactions.

      <h2>Performance Computing</h2>
      <p>
        The performance of any computer system can be evaluated in measurable,
        technical terms, using one or more of the metrics listed above. This way
        the performance can be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Compared relative to other systems or the same system before/after
          changes
        </li>
        <li>In absolute terms, e.g. for fulfilling a contractual obligation</li>
      </ul>

          alt=""
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst the above definition relates to a scientific, technical approach,
        the following definition given by Arnold Allen would be useful for a
        non-technical audience:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The word performance in computer performance means the same thing that
          performance means in other contexts, that is, it means "How well is
          the computer doing the work it is supposed to do?"

        Since the best place to start is always at the beginning, let’s kick
        things off by tackling the question what exactly is brand identity?
      </p>
      <p className="extra-margin-bottom">
        The terms “brand,” “branding,” and “brand identity” are sometimes
        treated as interchangeable, but that’s not the case.

        Your brand identity is what makes you instantly recognizable to your
        customers. Your audience will associate your brand identity with your
        product or service, and that identity is what forges the connection
        between you and your customers, builds customer loyalty, and determines
        how your customers will perceive your brand.
